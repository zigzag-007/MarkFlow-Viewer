# MarkFlow Viewer

**Your Markdown, Elevated: Write, Preview, and Perfect.**

## üöÄ Overview

MarkFlow Viewer is a powerful, feature-rich, and beautifully redesigned GitHub-style Markdown editor and live previewer. It operates entirely client-side, ensuring your data remains private and secure. This project builds upon and significantly enhances the foundational work of the original [Markdown-Viewer by ThisIs-Developer](https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Markdown-Viewer/).

Our goal was to take a fantastic concept and elevate it with a more polished user interface, a stunning new Purple x Blue dark theme, an improved light theme, and numerous under-the-hood enhancements for a smoother, more professional experience.

## üôè Acknowledgments & Inspiration

This project, MarkFlow Viewer, stands on the shoulders of giants. **It was heavily inspired by and evolved from the original [Markdown-Viewer by @ThisIs-Developer](https://github.com/ThisIs-Developer/Markdown-Viewer/).**

We've taken much of the core idea, initial design inspiration, and feature set from their incredible work. Many of the upgrades, the new visual themes, and feature enhancements in this version were built directly upon or as an evolution of their initial design.

**Frankly, without @ThisIs-Developer's original repository, this enhanced version wouldn't have been possible.** We are immensely grateful for their contribution to the open-source community and for providing such a solid foundation to build upon. We encourage you to check out their original project!
